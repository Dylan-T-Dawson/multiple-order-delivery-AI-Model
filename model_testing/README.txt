The models included were optimized for the diagnol sum of the average probabilities per class for multi-class classification. There are a variety of other possible ways to train the models, so these may not be optimized for every problem. You can choose whether to oversample or not, to use accuracy as a metric rather than the diagonal sum, and whether or not to combine the data in one of two binary ways. The models were also trained using only a small number of evaluation rounds during hyperparameter tuning, so better results could likely be achieved with more training.
